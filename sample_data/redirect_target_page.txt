The '''Battle of Kwajalein''' was fought as part of the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]] of [[World War II]]. It took place from 31 January-3 February 1944, on [[Kwajalein Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]]. Employing the hard-learned lessons of the [[battle of Tarawa]], the United States launched a successful twin assault on the main islands of Kwajalein in the south and [[Roi-Namur]] in the north. The Japanese defenders put up stiff resistance, although outnumbered and under-prepared. The determined defense of Roi-Namur left only 51 survivors of an original garrison of 3,500.

For the US, the battle represented both the next step in its [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island-hopping]] march to Japan and a significant moral victory because it was the first time the Americans had penetrated the "outer ring" of the Japanese Pacific sphere. For the Japanese, the battle represented the failure of the beach-line defense. Japanese defenses became prepared in depth, and the battles of [[Peleliu]], [[Guam]], and the [[Marianas]] proved far more costly to the US.

==Background==

===Geography===
Kwajalein Atoll is in the heart of the Marshall Islands. It lies in the Ralik Chain, {{convert|2100|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] at {{coord|8|43|N|167|44|E}}. Kwajalein is the world's largest coral atoll and comprises 93 islands and islets, it has a land area of 1,560&nbsp;acres (6.33&nbsp;km²),<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|12}} and surrounds one of the largest lagoons in the world, measuring 324&nbsp;mi² (839&nbsp;km²) in size.

The two most significant land masses are Kwajalein Island in the south, and the linked islands of Roi-Namur in the north. By the start of World War II, the Marshalls ([[South Pacific Mandate]]) were already an integral part of the Japanese perimeter of defense. Its facilities were being utilized as outlying bases for submarines and surface warships, as well as for air staging for future advances being planned against [[Tuvalu|Ellice]], the [[Fiji Islands]], and [[Samoa]].

===Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign===
After the [[battle of Makin|capture of Makin]] and [[battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] in the [[Gilbert Islands]], the next step in the [[United States Navy]]'s campaign in the central [[Pacific Ocean Areas|Pacific]] was the Marshall Island chain.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|7}} These islands had been [[Germany|German]] colonies, after their purchase from Spain in 1899,<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|11}} until [[World War I]], when they were assigned to Japan in the post-war settlement as the "Eastern Mandates". The islands had become a mystery since the Japanese closed them to the outside world. It was presumed the Japanese had built illegal fortifications throughout the islands, however the precise extent of any such fortifications was unknown.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|9}} To the Japanese, regarding them as part of the "outer ring" of Japanese territory.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|10}}

The strategic importance of the Marshalls had been identified as early as 1921 in [[War Plan Orange|Plan Orange]]—the American interwar plan for a possible conflict with Japan. The Marshalls were a key step in the island-hopping march to mainland Japan.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|7}}

After the loss of the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[New Guinea]] to the Allies in 1943, the Japanese command decided that the Gilbert and Marshall Islands would be expendable.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|21}} They preferred to fight a decisive battle closer to home. However, at the end of 1943, the Marshalls were reinforced to make their taking expensive for the Americans. By January 1944, the regional commander in [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]]—Admiral [[Masashi Kobayashi]]—had 28,000 troops to defend the Marshalls, but he had very few planes.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|33}}

===Japanese planning and preparations===
The 6th Base Force, under the command of Rear Admiral [[Monzo Akiyama]], and headquartered on Kwajalein since August 1941, was the principal defense force of the islands.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|31}} Akiyama, however, had his men spread out over a very wide area, with IJN air bases located on [[Roi-Namur]], [[Mili Atoll|Mille]], [[Maloelap]], [[Eniwetok]], and [[Wotje]]).<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|31}} Garrison troops on the island included the 1st Company, 3rd Mobile Battalion, 1st Amphibious Brigade, plus units of the 2nd Mobile Battalion.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|31}}

The defense system on the islands was mostly in line, with little or no depth.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|33}} The Japanese had twin 12.7&nbsp;cm guns on each end of the island plus 80mm guns on the ocean and lagoon sides.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|35}}  The 22nd Air Flotilla, depleted after the Gilbert campaign, had 128 aircraft in the Marshalls, 10 on Kwajalein.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|31}}

===US planning and preparation===
The Marshall campaign planned by the US, involved attacks on seven islands, bypassing many more.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|18}}  [[Operation Flintlock (World War II)|Operation ''Flintlock'']] had nine phases, the main phase being the capture of Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls, a second phase, Operation Catchpole, being the capture of Eniwetok, and remaining phases being the capture of remaining islands.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|18}}  Bombardment by the [[Seventh Air Force]], and a carrier air attack on 4 Dec. 1943, followed by additional attacks in Jan. 1944, destroyed all Japanese aircraft.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|36,18}}  The [[4th Marine Division (United States)|4th Marine Division]]—under Major General [[Harry Schmidt (USMC)|Harry Schmidt]]—was assigned to Roi-Namur, and the Army's [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]]—under Major General [[Charles H. Corlett]]—would make the assault on Kwajalein.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|18}}

Staging through [[Baker Island]] airfield, [[B-24 Liberator]]s of the  quickly set their sights upon their targets. In the beginning, the most important was Mili Atoll, the Japanese base closest to the Gilberts and Maloelap, the most powerful enemy bases threatening the upcoming operations. Mille was the subject of several attacks throughout November, causing considerable damage to installations and high losses of aircraft for the Japanese. But Mille remained the only base within fighter reach of the Gilberts, and the defenders managed to keep the facilities there operational and reinforced with aircraft. Following the capture of Tarawa and until 19 December, 106&nbsp;B-24s dropped a total of {{convert|122|ST|t|abbr=on}} of explosives on Mille's airbase. The largest of those raids came on 4 December when 34 B-24s pulverized the atoll in conjunction with carrier-based bombing raids of other parts of the Marshalls. On 18 December, renewed strikes were initiated against enemy targets on Mille with land-based [[Douglas SBD Dauntless#Variants|Douglas A-24 Banshee]] dive bombers and [[Bell P-39]] Airacobra fighters making their debut in the Marshall air offensive. Japanese losses for the day amounted to 10 fighters (four on the ground) and four damaged. Other aircraft types participating in the offensive included [[B-25 Mitchell]]s and [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]]s.

It was necessary to take another atoll in the eastern Marshalls—Majuro. This feature is {{convert|220|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} southeast of Kwajalein and could serve as an advanced air and naval base as well as safeguard supply lines to Kwajalein. Majuro was very lightly defended and only the [[V Amphibious Corps]] Marine Reconnaissance Company and the 2nd [[Battalion]], 106th Infantry, [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] were employed in its capture. The island was taken on 31 January 1944, without any US casualties.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|37–38}}

==Battle==
[[File:Battle of Kwajalein map.png|right|300px]]
The U.S. forces for the landings were [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Richmond K. Turner]]'s 5th Fleet Amphibious Force, and Major General [[Holland M. Smith]]'s [[V Amphibious Corps]], which comprised the [[U.S. 4th Marine Division|4th Marine Division]] commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Harry Schmidt (USMC)|Harry Schmidt]], the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Charles H. Corlett]], plus the [[22nd Marines]], 106th Infantry and [[111th Infantry Regiment (United States)|111th Infantry]] regiments. The 4th and 7th Divisions were assigned to the initial landings at Kwajalein, while the 2nd Battalion of the 106th was assigned to the simultaneous capture of Majuro Atoll. The rest of the 106th and the 22nd Marines were in reserve for Kwajalein, while awaiting the following [[Battle of Eniwetok|assault on Eniwetok]], scheduled for three months later.

The [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] began by capturing the small islands labeled Carlos, Carter, Cecil, and Carlson on 31 January, which were used as [[artillery]] bases for the next day's assault.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|54–67}} Kwajalein Island is {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} long but only {{convert|880|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide. There was therefore no possibility of [[defence in depth]], so the Japanese planned to counter-attack the landing beaches.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|33}} They had not realized until the battle of Tarawa that American amphibious vehicles could cross coral reefs and so land on the lagoon side of an atoll; accordingly the strongest defences on Kwajalein faced the ocean.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|33}} The bombardment by the Southern Attack Force, including the [[USS Tennessee (BB-43)]],<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|44,54}} plus B-24 bombers from [[Apamama]] and artillery on Carlson was devastating. The U.S. Army history of the battle quotes a participant as saying that "the entire island looked as if it had been picked up 20,000&nbsp;feet and then dropped." Landing beaches Red 1 and 2 were assaulted at 0930 on 1 Feb., reaching half way across the runway by sunset.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|56–60}}  Although the Japanese counterattacked every night, the island was declared secure by the end of the fourth day.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|66}}

On the north side of the atoll, the 4th Marine Division followed the same plan, first capturing islets Ivan, Jacob, Albert, Allen, and Abraham on 31 January, and landing on Roi-Namur on 1 February.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|38–54}} The airfield on Roi (the eastern half), was captured quickly, and Namur (the western half), fell the next day. The worst setback came when a Marine demolition team threw a [[satchel charge]] of high explosives into a Japanese bunker which turned out to be a [[torpedo]] warhead magazine. The resulting explosion killed twenty Marines and wounded dozens more.<ref>{{cite web|last=Duncan|first=Basil|title=Roi-Namur|url=http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Plains/5850/marshalls.html|work=THE MARSHALL ISLANDS CAMPAIGN|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Knox KwajaleinFlag 1944 g44879.jpg|thumb|300px|SecNav [[Frank Knox]] presented with the flag that flew over Kwajalein, 1944]]

The relatively easy capture of Kwajalein demonstrated US amphibious capabilities and showed that the changes to training and tactics after the bloody battle of Tarawa had been effective.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|89}} It allowed Nimitz to speed up operations in the Marshalls and invade Ebeye Island on 3-4 Feb., Engebi Island on 18-19 Feb., Eniwetok Island on 19-21 Feb., and Parry Island on 22-23 Feb. 1944.<ref name=Rottman/>{{rp|66–85}}

The Japanese learned from the battle that beachline defenses were too vulnerable to bombardment by ships and planes. In the campaign for the Mariana Islands, the defense in depth on [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]] and [[battle of Peleliu|Peleliu]] was much harder to overcome than the thin line on Kwajalein.
